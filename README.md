# Problem
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers awarding point based on each recorded 
purchase as follows:

For Every dollar Spend over $50 on the transaction, the customer receives one point. In addition,
for every dollar spent over $100, the customer receives another point. 

Ex: for a $120 purchase the customer receives 90 points (((120 - 50) * 1) + ((120 - 100) + 1))

# Database
Created a local database usingH2 which will be initialized by loading few customers and 
respective transactions during application start. Schema for both will be shown as below:

![Customer Schema](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")


# Data Access layer
Used a Hibernate to perform all crud operations
